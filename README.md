# GraphX
A library that makes DOM commands simpler. It allows you to create special animations using the DOM oriented methods from within the library.

**Importing it to your project**

You can import the GraphX library by importing the source into your `HTML` file (below is the latest release).

```html
<script src='https://gearshiftstudios.github.io/GraphX/releases/stable/graphx@0.0.1.js'></script>
```

You can import an older version by changing the numbers after the `@` in the URL.

**Usage**

Here is an example of how you could use the GraphX library.

****HTML****

```html
<div id='my-text'>This is some text!</div>
```

****JavaScript****

```javascript
graphx.setColor('my-text', 'white')
```
